# Discord-Bots
A few discord bots I have made, written in Python (Version 3.6)

## Connect Link Bot
This bot converts a connect string input by the user, to a clickable link that will open the specified game and join the server. For example, "connect ip:port; password pw" -> "steam://connect/ip:port/pw".

For the bot to join your server, click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=371276000023281665&scope=bot&permissions=0).

## TF2 Logs Bot
This bot takes a logs.tf link as an input, and then produces some output to the server chat. This output includes the name of the log, the map, the length of time the game lasted, and the combined scored, kills and damage for each team. There is also an image preview of the logs.tf webpage.

For the bot to join your server, click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=318500338443223051&scope=bot&permissions=0).
